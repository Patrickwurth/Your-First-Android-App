# Your-First-Android-App
There is a lot to learn the first week to get started just building and running your first android app. Ideally by the end of the week, I want everyone to have done the following:

1) Have read the Introduction to Android concept chapter and/or slide deck.

2) Install Android Studio

3) Create a 'Hello World' App

4) Create an emulated Virtual Device and run the app on it (optionally, but ideally: also run the app on a physical device)

5) Basic introductory understanding of the Gradle build system and configs

Introduction and Hello World App Codelab Guide (Links to an external site.)

The due date for this assignment gives an extra week in case anyone gets stuck (these first steps are critical to success in this class, especially in an online format), however you should expect weekly assignments generally due on Sunday nights.

Deliverables (expect this format every week):

-submit the final build  (the .apk file is the android app executable)

-submit a link to your code hosted in a code repository (I don't care where, a personal github account is standard, as long as I have access to it. My github username is michaelclarkjr,  (Links to an external site.)please make sure I have permissions to view.)

-submit screenshots (or a video) of each task above. I want to be able to see the app running in a virtual device, the logcat statement, and the successful gradle sync.
